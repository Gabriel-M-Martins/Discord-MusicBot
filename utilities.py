class Queue:
    """
    A class used to represent a queue.

    This class handles all sort of Queue operations, making it easy to just
    call these methods in main.py without worrying about breaking anything in queue.

    Attributes
    ----------
    current_music_url : str
        The current url of the current music the bot is playing.

    current_music_title : str
        The current name of the current music the bot is playing.

    current_music_thumb : str
        The current thumbnail url of the current music the bot is playing.

    last_title_enqueued : str
        The title of the last music enqueued.

    queue : tuple list
        The actual queue of songs to play.
        (title, url, thumb)

    Methods
    -------
    enqueue(music_title, music_url, music_thumb)
        Handles enqueue process appending the music tuple to the queue
        while setting last_title_enqueued and the current_music variables as needed

    dequeue()
        TO DO!
        Removes the last music enqueued from the queue.

    previous()
        Goes back one place in queue, ensuring that the previous song isn't a negative index.
        current_music variables are set accordingly.

    next()
        Sets the next music in the queue as the current one.

    theres_next()
        Checks if there is a music in the queue after the current one.

    clear_queue()
        Clears the queue, resetting all variables.
